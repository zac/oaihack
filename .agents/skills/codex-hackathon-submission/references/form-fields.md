# Submission Form Fields

Use this as a starting point and verify against the live submission form before finalizing.

Required fields observed in the submission UI screenshot:
- Team members list
- Project description
- Public GitHub repository URL
- Demo video URL
- Codex feedback
- Model usage and number of parallel agents
- Team social handles (X / LinkedIn)

Guidance per field:
- Project description: 4–7 sentences covering problem, user, solution, AI/Codex usage, and what the demo proves.
- Public GitHub repository: must be public and include a README with setup and run steps.
- Demo video: short, clear narrative showing the end-to-end flow.
- Codex feedback: include 1–3 wins, 1–3 friction points, and any bugs or feature requests.
- Model/agents: list models exactly (e.g., GPT-4.1) and the maximum number of agents running in parallel.
- Social handles: provide each team member’s X and LinkedIn handles or URLs.

Deadline handling:
- Stated deadline: Thursday, February 5, 2026 at 4:00 PM PT.
- Always restate the deadline as an absolute date and time with timezone and confirm. If the user says “Thursday 4pm,” restate it as “February 5, 2026 at 4:00 PM PT.”
