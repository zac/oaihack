Use this structure to keep the demo crisp and aligned to the submission narrative.

- Hook: 1 sentence on the problem and who it affects.
- Solution: 1 sentence on what you built.
- Live flow: show the core user journey end-to-end.
- AI moment: 1–2 sentences on where Codex or the model adds value.
- Proof: show the output or result clearly.

Tips:
- Show the product working before showing how it was built.
