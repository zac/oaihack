# Requirements and Judging

Use this as the source of truth for ideation and storytelling alignment.

Problem statement:
Build the most compelling application powered by Codex, showcasing how an AI coding agent unlocks new creative workflows and automates real developer tasks. Teams should demonstrate not just what they built, but how Codex was used under the hood to meaningfully accelerate or transform the build process.

Rules and constraints:
- Open source only. Everything shown in the demo must be fully open source, including backend, frontend, models, and other components under an approved open source license.
- New work only. Projects must be started from scratch during the hackathon.
- Team size: up to 4 members.
- Disallowed projects include those that violate legal, ethical, or platform policies, or use assets without rights.
- OpenAI employees are not eligible to participate.

Sample anti-projects to avoid:
- AI mental health advisor.
- Basic RAG applications.
- Streamlit applications.
- Image analyzers.
- “AI for Education” chatbots.
- AI job application screeners.
- AI nutrition coaches.
- Personality analyzers.
- Any project using AI to generate or give medical advice.

Submission requirements:
- Submit via the official form once hacking is complete.
- Submission includes a short one-minute demo video of what you built.
- The demo video can be hosted on YouTube, Loom, or similar.

- Demo and Pitch (25%): Novel, interesting concept. Demo and presentation quality. Show an implemented idea, not slides or a Figma.
