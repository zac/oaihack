# Idea Scorecard

Score each idea 1–5 in each category. Multiply by weight to get a total out of 25.

Impact (25%):
1 = unclear user or benefit
3 = clear user and benefit, moderate impact
5 = strong user need, compelling long-term impact

Codex App Story (25%):
1 = Codex is incidental
3 = Codex used, but not central to the story
5 = Codex is the core accelerator with parallel agents and worktrees

Creative Use of Skills (25%):
1 = minimal or generic skill use
3 = some skill use for coding tasks
5 = strong, practical skills usage across coding and non-technical technical work

Demo and Pitch (25%):
1 = hard to demo or too abstract
3 = demoable with setup risk
5 = crisp, novel, demo-ready in 60–120 seconds without slides

Parallelizability (bonus factor):
1 = mostly sequential work, hard to split across agents
3 = some parallel work possible (frontend/backend or docs/tests)
5 = highly parallelizable with a harness, clear task contracts, and multiple worktrees

Selection rule:
- Pick the highest scoring idea that passes all rules and has at least a 3/5 in Parallelizability.
- Keep a fallback idea within 10% of the top score.
