Teams should demonstrate not just what they built, but how Codex was used under the hood to meaningfully accelerate or transform the build process.

## 8. Judging & Submissions

Judges will be taking place on Thursday, February 5th. These judges are evaluating your **technical demos** in the below categories. *Show us what you have built* to solve our problem statements. Please **do not** show us a presentation. We'll be checking to ensure your project was built **entirely during the event**; no previous work is allowed.

Teams should submit [here](https://cerebralvalley.ai/e/openai-codex-hackathon/hackathon/submit) when they have completed hacking. In the submission form, you will have to submit a short one minute demo video. This should be a video of what you have built, uploaded to Youtube, Loom, or somewhere else.

**Judging Criteria:**

1. **Impact (25%):** What is the project’s long-term potential for success, growth and impact? Does it fit into the problem statement? Is the project useful, and for who?
2. **Codex App (25%):** Built with the Codex app – tell a creative, end-to-end story of how Codex enabled the build with parallel agents and worktrees
3. **Creative Use of Skills (25%):** Creative use of skills – strong practical use of skills in Codex for coding workflows, developer tasks, and “non-technical technical work”
4. **Demo & Pitch (25%):** Is the concept of this project novel and interesting to watch? Is it presented and demo’d well (NOT just a presentation, figma file, or anything else)? How well has the team implemented the idea?

**Judging Process:**

Judging proceeds in two rounds:

- Hackers will be assigned to judging groups, ~3 minutes to pitch followed by 1-2 minutes of Q/A
- The top **five** teams in ranking will get to demo on stage to a panel of judges; ~3 minutes to pitch followed by 2-3 minutes for Q/A.
