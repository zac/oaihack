## What Codex Did
- Located skills in `.agents/skills` and identified: `codex-hackathon-ideation`, `codex-hackathon-submission`, `codex-devlog`.
- Created the `codex-devlog` skill with a workflow and template to capture acceleration notes.
- Generated the first devlog entry focused on hackathon setup skills.
- Reviewed today's Codex session logs for `oaihack` context (including hackathon detail extraction and ideation-skill update requests).

## Acceleration Notes
- Before/after: Manual cataloging and templating replaced with an automated skill and structured entry.
- Time saved (estimate): 30-60 minutes.
- Bottlenecks removed: Repetitive setup steps for logging and consistent format.
- Human decisions required: Which skills to highlight and the focus on hackathon startup.

## Changes
- Files touched: .agents/skills/codex-devlog/SKILL.md; .agents/skills/codex-devlog/assets/devlog-template.md; .agents/skills/codex-devlog/agents/openai.yaml; codex-log/2026-02-05_1034-hackathon-skills.md
- Summary of edits:
- Added a new devlog skill and its template.
- Created the first session log entry.
- Commits/PRs: n/a

## Next Steps
- Confirm if additional hackathon setup skills should be added or refined.
- Commit the new skill and devlog entry when ready.
