## What Codex Did
- Reviewed the project idea document and hackathon details.
- Created AGENTS.md with project focus, repo layout, and skill usage guidance.

## Acceleration Notes
- Before/after: manual doc drafting and repo orientation vs. a structured, ready-to-use agent guide.
- Time saved (estimate): 20-30 minutes.
- Bottlenecks removed: consolidating skill usage guidance and MVP focus into one place.
- Human decisions required: confirm scope and MVP priorities.

## Changes
- Files touched: AGENTS.md
- Summary of edits:
  - Added hackathon project focus and MVP priorities.
  - Documented repo layout and skill usage triggers.
- Commits/PRs: n/a

## Next Steps
- Start the SwiftUIRender package core types (JSON value, render tree, catalog registry).
- Wire the package into RenderChat for a minimal render preview.
