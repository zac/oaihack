## What Codex Did
- Captured current session metadata and repository status.
- Logged that the recent form-flow visibility behavior was reverted to return to prior UX behavior.
- Recorded that no additional implementation changes were requested in this step.

## Acceleration Notes
- Before/after: Instead of further debugging, this session focused on preserving momentum by documenting the rollback decision clearly.
- Time saved (estimate): 10-15 minutes.
- Bottlenecks removed: ambiguity about why the prior behavior is now present.
- Human decisions required: user chose to revert and avoid additional fixes for now.

## Changes
- Files touched: /Users/zac/Projects/personal/oaihack/codex-log/2026-02-05_1528-reverted-form-visibility.md
- Summary of edits:
- Added a new devlog entry documenting the rollback decision and context.
- Noted that code-path fixes were intentionally not pursued in this step.
- Commits/PRs: n/a

## Next Steps
- If needed later, re-open the form-flow issue with explicit desired placement behavior (transcript bubble vs. takeover composer vs. both).
